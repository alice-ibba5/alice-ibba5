### Hi there 👋

- 👩‍💻 I'm a full-stack web developer with a background as diverse as my interests! 🎨

- 🏛️ After graduating in architecture, I delved into interior design and its various styles, along with architecture for wellness and graphic design. Starting out as an architectural assistant, I later transitioned into freelancing.

- 🚀 Recently, fueled by my passion for technology and web development, I embarked on a 6-month journey to become a full-stack web developer.

- 📖 My skills span both frontend and backend development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Bootstrap, and MongoDB.

- 🏴 Fluent in both Italian and English, I thrive in diverse linguistic environments.

- 💡 I like to think of myself as a multipotentialite, with a plethora of interests and creative passions. In addition to technology, I'm deeply fascinated by psychology, sustainability, well-being, and design.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Java and Spring Boot
